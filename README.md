# South Sudan Project 

Welcome to our repository, housing the culmination of our efforts in response to the challenge presented by the Zero Hunger Lab (ZHL) within the framework of the JBG060 class. Our mission was to enhance ZHL's approach to developing a predictive model for anticipating food crises in South Sudan, leveraging news articles as a key feature. In the following section you will find a description of each notebook's purpose.
